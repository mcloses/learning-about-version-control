## Learning about Version Control
Author: Marcel Closes Pagan

"Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!"

-> The thing I like the most about version control is the ability to force collaborators to review PRs so testing is done in different machiens

-> The most frustrating thing when working with version control is knowing when should you split feature branches in subfeature branches so PRs are somewhat reviewable and there aren't 500+ lines of code to understand and revisit (specially when that certain feature is assinged to just one collaborator).
